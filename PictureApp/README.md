# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm constantly exploring new ways to build intuitive and useful applications. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI, particularly in handling data persistence and working with device capabilities like the camera and photo library.

**Picture App** is a simple and user friendly iOS application that allows users to capture or upload photos, write captions, and store them as organized "photo notes." These notes are persistently saved and can be viewed, edited, or deleted within the app. The goal was to build an app that not only functions smoothly but also adheres to common architectural patterns like MVVM for maintainability and scalability.

To use the app:
1. Launch the app on your iOS device or simulator.
2. Tap to add a new photo note.
3. Choose to take a new photo or select one from your library.
4. Enter a caption and save the note.
5. View, edit, or delete saved notes from the list.
